Here’s a **concise and structured overview** of Networking Basics covering TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, TLS, UDP, and DNS:

## 🌐 Networking Basics

### 1️⃣ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* **Type:** Connection-oriented, reliable transport protocol.
* **Key Features:**

  * Ensures **ordered**, **reliable** delivery of data.
  * Uses **3-way handshake** (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) to establish a connection.
  * Handles **error detection** and **retransmissions**.
* **Use Cases:** Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), file transfer (FTP), email (SMTP/IMAP/POP3).

---

### 2️⃣ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* **Type:** Connectionless, lightweight transport protocol.
* **Key Features:**

  * No handshake → lower latency.
  * No guarantee of delivery, order, or duplicate protection.
  * Small header → efficient for real-time traffic.
* **Use Cases:** Video streaming, VoIP, online gaming, DNS queries.

---

### 3️⃣ HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

* **Layer:** Application layer (runs on TCP, usually port 80).
* **Key Features:**

  * Stateless protocol → each request/response is independent.
  * Methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, etc.
  * Uses request-response model (client → server).
* **Limitation:** Plain text → not encrypted → vulnerable to eavesdropping.

---

### 4️⃣ HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

* **HTTP + TLS/SSL encryption** (runs on TCP, usually port 443).
* **Key Features:**

  * Ensures **confidentiality** (encryption), **integrity** (no tampering), and **authentication** (server identity).
  * Protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
* **Use Cases:** Secure websites, online banking, e-commerce.

---

### 5️⃣ TLS (Transport Layer Security)

* **Purpose:** Cryptographic protocol that secures communication over TCP.
* **How it works:**

  1. **Handshake:** Negotiates encryption algorithm and exchanges keys.
  2. **Authentication:** Server (and sometimes client) prove identity with certificates.
  3. **Encryption:** Securely transmits data with symmetric encryption.
* **Replaced:** SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

---

### 6️⃣ DNS (Domain Name System)

* **Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `openai.com`) into IP addresses.
* **How it works:**

  * Recursive query: Client → DNS resolver → root → TLD → authoritative server.
  * Returns IP address to client.
* **Key Components:**

  * **A record:** IPv4 address of a domain.
  * **AAAA record:** IPv6 address.
  * **CNAME:** Alias.
  * **MX record:** Mail server info.
* **Port:** UDP/53 (usually), TCP/53 for large responses (e.g., zone transfers).

### 🧠 Quick Comparison Table

| Protocol/Service | Layer          | Reliable?          | Encrypted?  | Typical Port |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| TCP              | Transport      | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No        | N/A          |
| UDP              | Transport      | ❌ No               | ❌ No        | N/A          |
| HTTP             | Application    | ✅ (via TCP)        | ❌ No        | 80           |
| HTTPS            | Application    | ✅ (via TCP)        | ✅ Yes (TLS) | 443          |
| TLS              | Security Layer | ✅ (depends on TCP) | ✅ Yes       | N/A          |
| DNS              | Application    | ❌ (UDP)            | ❌ No        | 53           |
