## üîê Data Privacy

Data privacy is about ensuring personal or sensitive information is collected, stored, processed, and shared in a secure and compliant way.
Key aspects:

* **Encryption:**

  * **At rest** ‚Üí Data stored in databases, files, or backups must be encrypted (e.g., AES-256).
  * **In transit** ‚Üí Data traveling over networks must be encrypted (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
  * **Key Management** ‚Üí Use secure key vaults (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault). Rotate keys regularly.
* **Access Control:**

  * Role-based (RBAC) or attribute-based (ABAC) access.
  * Principle of least privilege (PoLP).
* **Data Minimization:**

  * Only collect what‚Äôs necessary.
  * Avoid retaining unnecessary PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

## üìÖ Data Retention

* **Policies:** Define how long data should be kept based on business, legal, and compliance needs.
* **Data Lifecycle Management:**

  1. **Collection** ‚Üí Capture only necessary data.
  2. **Storage** ‚Üí Securely store with encryption.
  3. **Access/Usage** ‚Üí Audit logs for usage and access.
  4. **Retention Period** ‚Üí Define retention timelines.
  5. **Deletion/Anonymization** ‚Üí Securely erase or anonymize after retention expires.
* **Techniques:**

  * Automated retention policies in DBs/storage (e.g., TTL in MongoDB, S3 lifecycle rules).
  * Pseudonymization / anonymization for analytics while protecting identities.
